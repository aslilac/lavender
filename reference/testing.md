# Emulator testing

I have a bunch of test roms that I will be sharing here soon.

I'll also be working on some unit tests that may be useful for others as well.
Unit testing your emulator is probably a very good idea. Emulators are big and
complex and breaking something that ends up being hard to trace down would ruin
anybodies day. If you have unit tests, you'll probably be able to figure out
what is broken pretty easily. Make sure to set it up with continuous integration
using Travis, AppVeyor, Circle, Github, or your other favorite that I haven't
heard of.
