# References
These links are all resources for development that I've found to contain useful,
up-to-date, accurate, and relevant information. I would really like to express my
appreciation to all of the people out there who put in the effort to create these
wonderful resources! Especially Jasper Vijn, the author of TONC. It's a great
compilation, with a lot of miscellaneous details that I may have never found
answers for without, as well as lots of test ROMs. This project may not have
been possible (or at least not as good) without their contribution.

- [ARM7TDMI Processor Technical Reference Manual](https://developer.arm.com/docs/ddi0210/c)
- [ARM Architecture Reference Manual (PDF)](https://developer.arm.com/docs/ddi0100/latest/armv5-architecture-reference-manual) -
Even though this manual is titled v5, it actually documents v4, v5, and v6. Don't
let the name confuse you, this is an incredible resource.
